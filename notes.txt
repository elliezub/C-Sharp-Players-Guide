OOP !!!

We split our program into multiple components called objects - objects work together to solve the overall problem
objects contain variables and methods - most objects have a few of each

every object belongs to a specific class or type 

an objects class determines the objects "shape"

all objects of the same class have the same data elements and methods, you can think of classes as catagories; 
everything in a class is similar in nature and structure

objects of a particular class are often called instances of the class
